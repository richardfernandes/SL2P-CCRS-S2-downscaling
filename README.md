# SL2P-CCRS-S2-downscaling
Workflow to produce 10m Sentinel-2 Products using SL2P-CCRS + Downscaling

This is a workflow that allows production of 10m resolution maps of vegetation biophysical parameters from Sentinel 2 satellite imagery.
The maps are generated by applying the SL2P-CCRS algorithm () to Sentinel 2 Imagery with 20m bands downscaled to 10m using ATPRK ().
